1.const cast operator: const cast<type>(expr)
    -> Explicitly overrides const and/or volatile in a cast
    -> Usually does not perform computation or change value

2.static cast operator: static cast<type>(expr)
    -> Performs a non-polymorphic cast
    -> Usually performs computation to change value â€“ implicit or user-defined

3.reinterpret cast operator: reinterpret cast<type>(expr)
    -> Casts between unrelated pointer types or pointer and integer
    -> Does not perform computation yet reinterprets value

4.dynamic cast operator: dynamic cast<type>(expr)
    -> Performs a run-time cast that verifies the validity of the cast
    -> Performs pre-defined computation, sets null or throws exception
